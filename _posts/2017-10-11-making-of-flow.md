Flow is a little bluesy track where I recorded audio (acoustic guitar and electric bass) after a long time, previously last couple of years I worked only with synths and it was all midi based setup. The music production workflow gets a bit different when you work with both audio and midi. I used reaper and free VST plugins and sounds for this projects.

## Audio
In this music project I worked at 96kHz sampling rate in Reaper. Used FLAC as internal audio file format, which reduces the overall project size a lot. At higher audio rate it becomes difficult use many FX, so used audio freezing to render individual tracks to save CPU uses.

## Cover art

Cover art was made in gimp. I was just playing around with gradients and filters.
