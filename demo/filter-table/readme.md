  - I can choose filtering to be **case sensitive**.
  - The filtering process is **interactive**, it happens as I type.
2. I can clear text input.

## Background story

This is a little project: where you can filter the data of a html table based on the given text input. This is a somewhat extended version of a tutorial found on w3school but I coded it from scratch. 

I thought I would be able to code it within an hour as I saw the basic code but it took me few days to implement the functionality and style that I was looking for.

So I realized that a project becomes quickly difficult and complex when you try to be creative or solve real world problems. You can read tutorial after tutorials, watch many videos and do lots of coding exercises but it's the projects-where you really learn the material by actually doing things and building stuffs!

Here is a codepen version:
